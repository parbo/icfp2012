Strategy:

1. Find lambdas
2. Find rocks/dirt that may need to be moved before taking the lambda
3. Find higher order rocks and convert to lambdas
4. Go to lift if possible

Each step is done with lots of A* path finding, with replanning when rocks fall.
If a path can't be reached, additional panic moves are performed.
Paths can go through beards if razors are carried.
If drowning is imminent, abort.
